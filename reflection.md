- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
I overloaded the constructor twice in the House and Library classes, and overloaded the constructor once in the Cafe class. Additionally, I overloaded the sellCoffee method in the Cafe class to have a simple method for buying a cup of coffee with no cream/sugar in it (so it only deducted the amount of coffee and a cup from the store's stock).
I found constructors to be the most useful type of method to overload, especially when making the CampusMap's main method. There was information that I didn't know about some of the buildings, so I could just use an overloaded constructor to build one without it. I wanted to overload a non-constructor method in the Library class, but I really couldn't find one that I could.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I used the comments from A6 to touch up some of my methods (mostly just adding RuntimeExceptions), which was really helpful! Should I still revise and resubmit?
